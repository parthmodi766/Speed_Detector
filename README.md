The Goal:
To create a system that can measure the speed of any vehicle moving in front of it.

Working:
Two sets of Infrared sensors were used in this project. One on each end of the system. As soon as a vehicle passes in front of one of the infrared sensor modules the Arduino board starts a timer and calculates the time it takes the vehicle to reach the other infrared sensor module. With the distance between the infrared sensor modules known, we were able to calculate the speed of the moving vehicle.

Components Used:
Arduino Mega,
Infrared Sensor Modules,
2x16 LCD Display.
